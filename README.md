 # CloudLock

`cloudLock` is a Python class designed for creating and managing file locks across different storage backends, including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and the local filesystem. This class can be used to ensure that only one process is accessing a particular file at any given time, preventing race conditions in concurrent environments.

## Features

- Supports Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and local filesystem.
- Configurable retry mechanism for acquiring and releasing locks.
- Uses `fsspec` for filesystem abstraction.

## Installation

Ensure you have `fsspec` and `xxhash` installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install fsspec xxhash
